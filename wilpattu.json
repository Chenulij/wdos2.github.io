The park's history begins with the copper shoreline at Kudiramalai, believed to have been the landing spot of Indian Prince Vijaya in the 5th century BC. The region's name, Thambapanni or the 'colour of copper', was derived from the reddish sand that stained Prince Vijaya's hands and feet. The park contains 68 archeological sites."
